# ZapYields

Zap in. Earn out.

ZapYields is a decentralized yield aggregator built on the Base Network. It allows users to "Zap" their USDC directly into a high-yield lending position powered by Moonwell, while participating in an on-chain, gamified referral ecosystem.

How it Works:

Underlying Protocol: All deposits are routed to Moonwell (mUSDC), ensuring institutional-grade security and liquidity.

Yield Streaming: Interest accrues every block (approx. 2 seconds).

Asset Protection: Users maintain 100% ownership of their principal. Referral commissions are paid strictly from yield generated, never from the deposit itself.

Performance Fees: The protocol charges a flat $2.00 network fee on withdrawal and a 10% performance fee on profits only.

The Energy Tier System: Referrers earn a continuous share of their downline's interest based on their own deposit level:

Spark: 10% Share

Volt: 20% Share

Surge: 30% Share

Thunder: 50% Share

Lightning: 80% Share
